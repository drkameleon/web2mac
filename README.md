# Web2Mac

**Convert any website/URL into a valid macOS app**

The whole thing works by wrapping Arturo's own Webview implementation and creating a macOS-compliant `.app` bundle, so that you can launch any website as a standalone app - or put it into your Dock. ;-)

## Usage

```bash
./web2mac.art YouTube https://youtube.com
```
